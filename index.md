## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2

    This was one of my favorite labs as we were able to use what we had learned about function, function definitions, and if statements in order to check and properly determine card and hand values in the game blackjack.  

* Lab 9, Part 1

    This lab was another of my favorites as in this lab we were able to use our learning of files and functions in order to open files and read the contents of said file in order to check for spelling mistakes and whether the word was in the dictionary file.

* Lab 12, Part 1

    Lab 12, part 1 was a fun lab as we learned about two new libraries, namely the Magick and math libraries, as well as used everything we have learned throughout the semester about functions, vectors, loops, and if statements in order to create an animated gif that runs smoothly.
